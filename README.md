## CHAPTER 1
### Introduction
#### 1.1 Introduction:
In today's rapidly evolving industrial landscape, the integration of cutting-edge technologies
has become essential for ensuring operational efficiency, productivity, and safety [1]. The
advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought forth a paradigm shift in how industries
monitor and manage their processes, enabling real-time data acquisition, analysis, and
decision-making. The focus of this project is to develop an IoT-based Factory Monitoring and
Protection System that leverages the capabilities of the ESP32-WROOM-32 module along with
various sensors to enhance factory safety and operational awareness.
#### 1.2 Background and Motivation:
Factories and industrial environments are characterized by complex operations, critical
machinery, and often hazardous conditions. Traditional methods of monitoring these
environments often fall short in providing timely information and alerts to prevent potential
mishaps or downtime. The rise of IoT technology offers a transformative solution by enabling
the collection and analysis of real-time data from a myriad of sensors. This data-driven
approach empowers factory operators and managers to make informed decisions, optimize
processes, and ensure the safety of personnel and assets.
#### 1.3 Problem Statement:
The existing methods of factory monitoring and protection often lack the ability to offer
comprehensive and real-time insights into the various operational parameters. Manual
monitoring can lead to delays in identifying anomalies, which may result in safety hazards,
equipment damage, or production interruptions [2]. Thus, there is a need for an advanced
system that seamlessly integrates sensors, data processing, and user-friendly interfaces to create
a comprehensive Factory Monitoring and Protection System.
#### 1.4 Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
 Design and Integration: Develop a robust IoT-based system that integrates multiple
sensors, including fire, ultrasonic, temperature, and humidity sensors, with the ESP32-
WROOM-32 module [3].
 Real-Time Monitoring: Enable real-time data acquisition from sensors placed
strategically within the factory environment to monitor key parameters affecting safety
and operations.
 Anomaly Detection: Implement algorithms for detecting anomalies such as fires,
abnormal temperature fluctuations, and unauthorized access, triggering immediate
alerts and appropriate actions.
2
 User Interface: Design an intuitive LCD display interface to present real-time sensor
data and alerts, providing factory personnel with actionable insights.
 Remote Accessibility: Explore the potential for remote monitoring and control via Wi-
Fi connectivity, allowing authorized personnel to access the system's data and controls
from remote locations.
 Enhanced Safety: Improve factory safety by providing early warnings for potential
fire hazards and adverse environmental conditions [4].
 Efficient Resource Management: Facilitate efficient use of resources by providing
insights into temperature and humidity conditions that may impact product quality or
machinery performance [5].
#### 1.5 Scope and Limitations:
While the IoT-based Factory Monitoring and Protection System offers substantial benefits, it's
important to acknowledge its scope and limitations. The system's scope encompasses the
integration of multiple sensors, data processing, and user interface design. However, the project
does not address complex issues such as advanced predictive maintenance algorithms or
integration with cloud platforms for extensive data analysis.
As we delve into the subsequent sections of this report, we will detail the methodology
employed to achieve the project objectives, the hardware and software components utilized,
the implementation process, data collection, analysis, and interpretation of results, challenges
encountered, future enhancements, and concluding reflections. Through this comprehensive
exploration, we aim to showcase the potential of IoT technology in revolutionizing factory
monitoring and protection, paving the way for safer, more efficient, and technologically
advanced industrial operations.

OLEDs). Some OLED displays have an I2C
interface, while others have an SPI interface.
One thing they all have in common, however, is that at their
core is a powerful single-chip CMOS OLED driver
controller – SSD1306, which handles all RAM buffering,
requiring very little work from your Arduino. [9]

3.3 DHT-11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor:
The DHT11 is a commonly used Temperature and humidity
sensor. The sensor comes with a dedicated NTC to measure
temperature and an 8-bit microcontroller to output the values of
temperature and humidity as serial data. The sensor is also factory
calibrated and hence easy to interface with other microcontrollers.
The sensor can measure temperature from 0°C to 50°C and humidity
from 20% to 90% with an accuracy of ±1°C and ±1%. So if you are
looking to measure in this range then this sensor might be the right
choice for you. [10]

3.4 MQ-2 Gas Sensor Module:
The MQ2 gas sensor is simple to use and has two different outputs.
It not only provides a binary indication of the presence of
combustible gasses, but also an analog representation of their
concentration in air.
The sensor’s analog output voltage (at the A0 pin) varies in
proportion to the concentration of smoke/gas. The higher the
concentration, the higher the output voltage; the lower the
concentration, the lower the output voltage. The animation below
shows the relationship between gas concentration and output
voltage.
MQ-2 Specifications:
Operating voltage 5V
Load resistance 20 KΩ
Heater resistance 33Ω ± 5%
Heating consumption <800mw
Sensing Resistance 10 KΩ – 60 KΩ
Concentration Range 200 – 10000ppm
Figure 3.5 MQ‐2 Gas
Sensor Module
9
Pin Specification`:
 VCC supplies power to the module. Connect it to the 5V output of your Arduino.
 GND is the ground pin.
 D0 indicates the presence of combustible gasses. D0 becomes LOW when the gas
concentration exceeds the threshold value (as set by the potentiometer), and HIGH
otherwise.
 A0 produces an analog output voltage proportional to gas concentration, so a higher
concentration results in a higher voltage and a lower concentration results in a lower
voltage.
3.5 Relay module:
A 5V relay module is a single or multi-channel relay module that works with a low-level trigger
voltage of 5V DC. The input voltage can be from
any microcontroller or logic chip that outputs a
digital signal. Like most other relays, the 5V
relay module is an electrically operated,
electromagnetic switch that can be used to turn
on or turn off a circuit. It consists of two parts:
the relay itself and the control module. The relay
contains the coil that creates the magnetic field,
the armature that move to complete or
disconnect a circuit, and contacts that open and
close to operate the load switch.
The relay control module is the interface or part
of the relay module that the user interacts with. It contains the input terminals for connecting
to the microcontroller, as well as the output terminals for connecting to the load. The control
module also contains LED indicators for power and status and other devices such as protection
diode, transistor, resistor, and other semiconductor devices necessary for its operation.
Relay Module Pinout
The 5V relay module pinout is composed of connections on the input side where it receives the
trigger signal, and the output side where it controls the load.
The input side, as shown in the above relay module circuit diagram, has 3 or 4 connections:
These are listed and explained below.
VCC – this is the power connection. It supplies 5V DC to the module and is normally
connected to the positive terminal of the power supply.
GND – this is the ground connection. It connects to the negative terminal of the power supply.
Figure 3.6 Relay Module
10
IN1, IN2 – these are the inputs where the trigger signal is applied. IN1 is for a single-channel
relay module, while IN2 is for a dual-channel relay module. The IN (Input) pin is connected to
the output of the microcontroller, sensor, or logic device.
The relay module output side has three connections:
 NO (Normally Open) – this is the load connection when the relay is ON. When the
relay is off, the NO maintains an open connection with the COM.
 COM (Common) – The relay module connection labeled “COM” is the common
connection for both the NO and NC (Normally Closed) pins.
 NC (Normally Closed) – this is the load connection. It connects to the COM terminal
by default, or when the relay is OFF.

3.6 Buzzer:
This buzzer is an active buzzer, which basically means that it will buzz at a predefined
frequency (2300 ±300 Hz) on its own even when you just apply steady DC power. If you are
looking for a buzzer can produce varied tones from an oscillating input signal, then take a look
at our buzzer. Some people prefer to get active buzzers since they can use them with steady DC
power but also be able to produce some variety of tones by applying
an oscillating signal. Some consider them to be more versatile than
their cousin, the passive buzzer, which is the type that requires an
oscillating signal to create any tone. It is possible, and often done,
to still create different tones through an active buzzer when you
apply an oscillating signal to the buzzer, but the spectrum of
possible different tones is very limited and not as crisp or clean of Figure 3.7 Buzzer
11
sound as can be produced with a buzzer. One advantage to an active buzzer is that you can still
produce a sound from the buzzer connected to a microcontroller, such as an Arduino, by just
driving a standard high output on the connected pin. The benefits of this are that you don't need
to use processing power, hardware timers, or additional code to produce sound.

3.7 LM35 Temperature Sensor:
LM35 is an integrated analog temperature sensor whose electrical output is proportional to
Degree Centigrade. LM35 Sensor does not require any external calibration or trimming to
provide typical accuracies. The LM35’s low output impedance, linear output, and precise
inherent calibration make interfacing to readout or control circuitry especially easy.
As such no extra components required to interface LM35 to ADC as the output of LM35 is
linear with 10mv/degree scale. It can be directly interfaced to any 10- or 12-bit ADC. But if
you are using an 8-bit ADC
like ADC0808 or ADC0804 an amplifier section
will be needed if you require to measure 1°C
change.
LM35 can also be directly connected to Arduino.
The output of LM35 temperature can also be
given to comparator circuit and can be used for
over temperature indication or by using a simple
relay can be used as a temperature controller.
The LM35 device is rated to operate over a −55°C
to 150°C temperature range, while the LM35C
device is rated for a −40°C to 110°C range (−10° with improved accuracy). The LM35-series
devices are available packaged in hermetic TO transistor packages, while the LM35C,
LM35CA, and LM35D devices are available in the plastic TO-92 transistor package. The
LM35D device is available in an 8-lead surface-mount small-outline package and a plastic TO-
220 package.

3.8 Flame Sensor:
A flame sensor is a device used to detect a fire. It is the most sensitive that can easily detect a
fire and activate a fire alarm. The detection range of a flame sensor is the wavelength in 760
nm to 1100 nm range of light source. High temperatures can damage the sensor so we should
place it at some distance. The detection distance is up to 100 cm. Its output is a digital or analog
signal. It can be used as a flame alarm or in the firefighting robots. It works by detecting
infrared radiation emitted from the fire. The detector detects this radiation and converts it into
the analog and digital signals for the microcontroller
to process.
Features:
 Indicator light: a green one for the switch, a
red one for power.
 Built in a potentiometer for sensitivity
control.

3.9 Ultrasonic Sensor:
Ultrasonic sensors are electronic devices that calculate the target’s distance by
emission of ultrasonic sound waves and convert those waves into electrical signals.
The speed of emitted ultrasonic waves traveling speed is faster than the audible
sound. There are mainly two essential elements
which are the transmitter and receiver. Using the
piezoelectric crystals, the transmitter generates
sound, and from there it travels to the target and
gets back to the receiver component.
To know the distance between the target and the
sensor, the sensor calculates the amount of time
required for sound emission to travel from
transmitter to receiver. The calculation is done
as follows:
D = 1/2 T * C
Where ‘T’ corresponds to time measured in seconds
‘C’ corresponds to sound speed = 343 measured in mts/sec

various fields such as engineering, material
science, chemistry, and more. The process
usually starts with creating a schematic that
shows how components are connected
throughout the circuit board. This is
followed by selecting the components,
placing them on the PCB, routing signals
and power planes. I am using easyEDA
software to design my PCB.

Software Implementation
5.1 Software Implementation: The software implementation of the IoT Based Factory
Monitoring and Protection System involves configuring the ESP32-WROOM-32 module to
communicate with the Blynk IoT platform using the Arduino IDE software. This section
provides a step-by-step guide to setting up the software components, integrating Blynk, and
programming the ESP32 for effective data communication, analysis, and user interaction.
5.2 Setting Up Arduino IDE: Install the Arduino IDE software on my development
computer. Configure the IDE for ESP32 development by adding the appropriate board manager
URL and installing the ESP32 board package.
Figure 5.1 Arduino installation
5.3 Blynk Account and Project Setup:
Create an account on the Blynk platform
(https://blynk.io/) if you don't have one. Create
a new Blynk project and note down the Auth
Token provided.
 Blynk Library Installation: Within
the Arduino IDE, navigate to "Sketch"
> "Include Library" > "Manage
Libraries." Search for "Blynk" and
install the Blynk library.
 Blynk Initialization: Include the
Blynk library at the beginning of your code: #include <BlynkSimpleEsp32.h> Initialize
Blynk with your Auth Token: char auth[] = "MY_AUTH_TOKEN";
 Wi-Fi Connection: Connect the ESP32 to your Wi-Fi network by providing your
network SSID and password: WiFi.begin("SSID", "PASSWORD");
Figure 5.2 Blynk library Installation

 Sensor Data Acquisition: Use appropriate libraries to read data from sensors. For
instance, read fire sensor data, ultrasonic distance, temperature, and humidity using
GPIO pins or relevant communication protocols.
 Blynk Widget Setup: In your Blynk project, add widgets (Virtual Pins) to correspond
with each sensor and the LCD display. Configure the widgets' properties, such as their
type (Gauge, Value Display, LED, etc.) and data display settings.
 Blynk Connection and Data Transmission: Inside the void setup() function, initiate
the Blynk connection: Blynk. begin(auth, "SSID", "PASSWORD");In the void loop()
function, regularly call Blynk.run() to maintain the Blynk connection. Use Blynk's
virtualWrite() function to send sensor data to the corresponding virtual pins on the
Blynk app.
 User Interface (Blynk App): Download the Blynk app from your preferred app store.
Create a dashboard and add widgets that correspond to the virtual pins you used in your
code. Configure widget properties to visualize and monitor sensor data, such as
temperature, humidity, and distance.
5.4 Deploying Code: Compile my code in the Arduino IDE. Connect the ESP32 to my
computer, select the correct board and port, and upload the code.
